# Analyzing-COVID-19-Data-and-Predicting-the-Next-Wave-2022

INTRODUCTION
 • As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, it is crucial 
to analyze the data and understand the trends to prepare 
for the next potential wave. 
• This presentation will explore country-wise data on cases, 
vaccines, and reactions, and use predictive modeling to 
forecast the future trajectory of the virus.
MACHINE LEARNING STEPS ON OUR DATA
 • Data Collection: Gathering Country-Wise Data
 • Data Analysis
 • Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
 • Feature Engineering
 • Selection of Models
 • Train and Test Model
 • Model Evaluation
 • Prediction
 • Visualization using matplotlib and Seaborn
 • Visualization Using Power-BI
